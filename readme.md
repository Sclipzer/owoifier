**What does the script do?**

The script replaces every "R" and "L" in a text with "W".

**How to use**

Windows: Open the command prompt and type in: python spoilerCopypasta.py

Mac: Right click the python file and run it using the Python launcher

When run the script will ask you to input a text. Simply paste/write a text and press enter and watch the script do its magic. After
it's done you can just copy the output and then press enter to stop the script.
